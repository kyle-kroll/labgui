# Reeves Lab GUI
This PyQt program interfaces with the PubMed API for retrieving the 100 most recent publications from our lab. The program will then display them and allow the user to select which ones they want to insert into our publication SQLite database. 

# Planned Features
* Text input for researchers
* Format retrieved information in tabular format
* Checkboxes to select/deselect items for insertion
* Buttons to push updates to the main website
